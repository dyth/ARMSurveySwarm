# Board

To create a randomised 1m * 1m board, run

> python board.py

to output a $ 10 * 10 $ 2D array of squares in `board.png`.

The conversion ratio between $ A4 : A0 $ is $ 1 : 4*\sqrt 2$. As the desired width of a square in the board is 10 cm, this corresponds to $1.76776695297$ cm, or $0.695971241$ inches.

`bigBoard.pdf` is a custom made board printed on 4 A0 sheets of paper. It can then be glued together to create a large `2m * 2m` board. This was created in `bigBoard.xlsx`, and scaled in `bigBoard.docx`.
