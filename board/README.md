# Board

`bigBoard.pdf` is a custom made board printed on 6 A0 sheets of paper. It can then be glued together to create a large `2m * 2m` board. This was created in `bigBoard.xlsx`. It has a border of 2 cm.

All boards should have a 2cm border to ensure good operation.

To create a randomised 1m * 1m board, run

> python board.py

to output a 10 * 10 2D array of squares in `board.png`.

The conversion ratio between `A4 : A0` is `1 : 4 `. As the desired width of a square in the board is 10 cm, this corresponds to 2.5 cm on A4.
