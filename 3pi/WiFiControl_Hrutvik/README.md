# Controlling Pololu m3pi robots over WiFi #

WiFi example for mbed OS

## Setup ##

### Configuring the ESP8266 WiFi module ###

Using the [mBed developer compiler](https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/), 
compile and flash the contents of the ```Pololu/ESP8266_Setup``` folder to the Pololu 3pi. Change the following in the ```main.cpp``` to match the credentials of the WiFi network that the robots and server will be connected to. Using serial port connection through a console such as Teraterm will be useful for this - be sure to set the baud rate to 115200.

```
char ssid[32] = "mySSID";     // enter WiFi router ssid inside the quotes
char pwd [32] = "myPASSWORD"; // enter WiFi router password inside the quotes
```
If successful, a non-zero IP address should be assigned to the Pololu.


### Server setup ###

Run ```Server/WiFiController.java``` from a terminal. Usage: ```java WiFiController <port>``` where ```<port>``` is the port on to use for the TCP socket server.

Once a Pololu is connected, its IP and MAC addresses will be shown, and instructions on controlling the Pololu will appear in the console.


### Pololu setup ###

Compile and flash the contents of ```Pololu/PololuController``` as before. Change the following in the ```main.cpp``` file to match the credentials of the WiFi network.

```
#define SERVIP "myIPaddress"
#define SERVPORT myPort
```

For first use, it is recommended that you use a serial port connection to ensure that setup occurs correctly.


##  Controlling the Pololu ##

1. Start the server, and immediately reset the Pololu mbed with the reset buttong

2. Wait for the Pololu to connect to the computer

3. Follow the instructions in the server console to control the Pololu
