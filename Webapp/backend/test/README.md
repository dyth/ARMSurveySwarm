Setup:

	Do **(in the parent directory!!!)**

		sudo npm install mocha chai

	To run tests, do (again from the parent directory):

		npm test
	
	(You may need to do `sudo npm test`)

	If that is not working, make sure that the server is not running.

	To write tests, read the docs here:

		http://mochajs.org/#getting-started

	All tests should go in the testing directory
