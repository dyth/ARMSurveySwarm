## 3pi

m3pi code to be flashed to the mbed on the robots.

## Setting up an IDE to create code to run on robots
1. Create an account at [ARM online compiler](https://developer.mbed.org/compiler).
2. Add [development board](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/) (on panel on right).
3. Create a program.
4. To download a program, press "Compile", and then copy and paste the downloaded file into the mbed over a miniUSB cable.
5. To run the program, press the reset button (the big central button).
